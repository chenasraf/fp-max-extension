# FP Max Extension

This is a tiny extension for quality-of-life improvements while browsing floatplane.com.

Current features:

- Remember last played position
- Show video progress on thumbnails
- Timestamp links in comments

üîê I try to make this extension secure and private, there is no tracking code anywhere. Trusting me
is nice, but if you don't that's a smart move - build this extension yourself: it is open source,
and available for peer review or forks.

üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è This extension is not affiliated with Floatplane, LMG or LTT in any capacity. Use it at your own
risk, and if something breaks, complain to me and not to the LMG staff. If you are from
LMG/Floatplane and would like me to take this down, please contact me.

## Installation

### Install through Chrome Web Store

The easiest way to install is using the
[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fp-max/bpneojingmonahfcbnojghpnnllngamc?hl=en&authuser=0)
link.

  > directories
- Drag the directory into your browser's extensions page.
  > Note you must have developer mode enabled on your browser for this to work

## Development

To develop new features or if you don't trust the extension on the Chrome Web Store or provided zip,
you should be able build this extension yourself.
